# Live-Weather-Data-and-Home-Automation-using-esp8266
This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to create a web server that displays live temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor and allows remote control of four lights. The project serves a webpage where users can monitor environmental conditions in real-time and control devices remotely.
